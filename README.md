## ðŸš€ Projects

### Project 1: [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/param-kasana/Movie_Recommender_System)
In this collaborative filtering project, we address diverse recommendation tasks, such as user-based (KNN-based Collaborative Filtering), item-based filtering (utilizing KNN), and propose an innovative solution for enhanced recommendation quality. Technologies employed include Python for implementation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Surprise for building and analyzing recommender systems, Jupyter for interactive development and Git for version control.

This project not only delves into the core aspects of collaborative filtering but also explores cutting-edge solutions for improved movie recommendations, offering a comprehensive view of the landscape through a variety of technologies and tools.

### [Project 2: Chatbot for Customer Support](Link to Project 2)
- Built a chatbot using natural language processing (NLP) to provide automated customer support.
- Technologies: Python, spaCy, Flask
