## ðŸš€ Projects

### Project 1: [Image Classification using Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/param-kasana/Traffic_Sign_Image_Classification)
This project aims to classify images of European road traffic signs using various machine learning techniques, with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to achieve accurate identification of traffic signs to enhance road safety and traffic management systems.

### Project 2: [JobQuest - The Job Search Website](https://github.com/param-kasana/Job_search_with_recommendation)
This repository contains the code for a job search website developed using the Flask web framework. The website allows job seekers to browse existing job adverts and enables employers to create new job adverts. The key feature of this website is the recommendation of job categories for newly created job adverts, based on pre-trained machine learning models.

### Project 3: [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/param-kasana/Movie_Recommender_System)
In this collaborative filtering project, I address diverse recommendation tasks, such as user-based (KNN-based Collaborative Filtering), item-based filtering (utilizing KNN), and propose an innovative solution for enhanced recommendation quality. Technologies employed include Python for implementation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Surprise for building and analyzing recommender systems, Jupyter for interactive development and Git for version control. This project not only delves into the core aspects of collaborative filtering but also explores cutting-edge solutions for improved movie recommendations, offering a comprehensive view of the landscape through a variety of technologies and tools.

### Project 4: [Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/param-kasana/Sentiment-Analysis-on-Reddit-Data)
This project focuses on analyzing Reddit data to address questions related to BMW, utilizing social media for market research. The comprehensive data science process is employed, covering data collection to findings communication. The learning outcomes include applying data science techniques to analyze social media and networks, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment and topic detection, and presenting insights derived from social media and network analysis. In the scenario, the goal is to showcase these capabilities to a potential client unfamiliar with social media analytics, with the project serving as market research for BMW.

### Project 5: [Social Network Analysis](https://github.com/param-kasana/Social_Network_Analysis)
This project involves the Social Network Analysis (SNA) of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement. The analysis aims to uncover insights, patterns, and key players within the FIRE community using various tools and techniques, with a particular focus on social media and network analysis. In addition to techniques used in the previous project, Network Graphs were used to analyse social networks by finding communities, identifying important nodes, and influence propagation.
